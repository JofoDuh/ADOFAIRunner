"Libraries" folder should exist if you've compiled your mod assembly before and the "AssetBundleStaging" should exist if you've compiled assets bundle with ThunderKit before. Once you've pinpointed the folder, input the path to this field.
        - Include PDB File: Just includes the PDB file when moving for debugging purposes.
        - Mod List: Here you can add all the ThunderKit pipeline for all the mods you are currently developing in the Unity Project modding environment.
